## What CDD Is

Context Driven Development is a specification-first way to build software where project intent lives in context files, not in transient chat state.

The most important principle is reproducibility: a project should be reconstructable from scratch from context files only, with clear outcomes and verifiable actions.

- Code is disposable; the durable IP is the problem-solving knowledge.
- Context files capture that knowledge as outcomes plus E2E-testable next actions.
- With strong context files, teams can rewrite code from scratch without losing features.

## What a Context File Is

A context file defines one desired outcome and the next actions required to reach it.

- One file = one outcome.
- Context files describe **what** to build, not implementation details.
- Each file uses required YAML frontmatter (`context_id`, `title`, `project`, `created`).
- Required sections are ordered: Desired Outcome, optional Reference, and Next Actions.
- Next Actions are black-box E2E testable and written as `Description` + `Test` table rows.

## What a Project Is

A project is an operational unit with its own project index at `.context/<project-name>/index.md`.

- The index is operational knowledge, not a numbered context spec.
- It documents overview, architecture, CLI usage, key dependencies, environment variables, and troubleshooting.
- It focuses on what the project does and how to run it, without embedding implementation code.
- Project metadata (`project_id`, status, dependencies) keeps project relationships and sequencing explicit.
