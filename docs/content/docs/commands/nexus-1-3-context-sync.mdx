description: Analysis-only context maintenance report across conversations and project indexes
---

This command maps conversation facts to existing context files and indexes, then proposes maintenance updates.

- Produces a "Context Sync Report" with suggested adds/edits/splits.
- Does not edit files directly.
- Focuses on alignment between current work and context inventory.

Use this after a long work session to identify context drift before making manual edits.
