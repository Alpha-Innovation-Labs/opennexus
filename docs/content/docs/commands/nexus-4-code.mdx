description: Technical-lead execution orchestrator for parallel implementation tracks
---

This command orchestrates implementation from an approved plan by splitting work into parallel tracks and coordinating delivery.

- Decomposes plan scope into independent workstreams.
- Chooses agent count dynamically (up to 6 concurrent tracks).
- Consolidates outcomes, blockers, and next actions into one handoff view.

Use this when you are ready to execute and want controlled parallelism instead of one linear coding pass.
