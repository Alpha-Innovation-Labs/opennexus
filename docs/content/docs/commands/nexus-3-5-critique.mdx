description: Pre-implementation critique that stress-tests plans before execution
---

This command pressure-tests a plan before coding starts by looking for flaws, risk clusters, and weak assumptions.

- Aggregates 3 focused critique angles into one prioritized output.
- Surfaces logic gaps, technical risks, and edge cases early.
- Produces findings ordered by impact and urgency.

Use this after planning and before implementation to reduce rework and prevent avoidable failures.
