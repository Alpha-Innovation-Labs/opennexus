description: Create new context specs from goals with correct structure and IDs
---

This command helps author a new context file from a user goal while enforcing naming, format, and testability standards.

- Checks overlap with existing contexts to avoid duplicates.
- Determines project prefix and next sequence ID.
- Produces properly formatted context files with E2E-testable Next Actions.

Use this when no existing context cleanly represents the requested outcome.
