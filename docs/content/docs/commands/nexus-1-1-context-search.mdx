description: Discover and rank relevant context files for a given request
---

This command scans `.nexus/context/` and identifies the most relevant Desired Outcomes and Next Actions for the current user request.

- Performs context discovery across project folders.
- Scores matches by relevance, not just keyword overlap.
- Returns structured results with ranked candidates and recommendations.

Use this before implementation when you need to anchor work to existing context files.
