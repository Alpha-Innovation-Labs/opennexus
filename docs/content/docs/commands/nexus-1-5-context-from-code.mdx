description: Propose context specs from observed user-facing behavior in code
---

This command analyzes a file or folder and proposes context candidates based on real behavior found in code.

- Spawns 3 subagents for parallel behavior analysis.
- Extracts user-visible outcomes and validation signals.
- Recommends either new context specs or updates to existing contexts.

Use this when code has evolved and you need context specs to catch up with reality.
