description: Strict orchestrator for full or incremental llms.txt generation
---

This command generates `llms.txt` through a gated orchestration pipeline with decomposition, assembly, and validation stages.

- Supports full generation and incremental regeneration modes.
- Enforces quality gates before output is accepted.
- Tracks run state in `.nexus/llms-state.json` for continuity and auditability.

Use this when project documentation has changed and you need a trustworthy AI-friendly `llms.txt` output.
