This command reviews context files for format and content quality, then proposes fix options interactively.

- Detects issues in frontmatter, required sections, and action testability.
- Suggests remediation and can propose splitting oversized contexts.
- Can optionally suggest AGENTS documentation updates after approval.

Use this before releases or handoffs when context quality and consistency are critical.
