description: Prompt rewriting assistant that returns only an improved prompt
---

This command rewrites a user's prompt to improve clarity, structure, and execution readiness without executing the request itself.

- Keeps user intent unchanged while improving wording and task framing.
- Returns only the rewritten prompt as the output payload.
- Triggers a reporting notification after completion.

Use this when the user has a vague or overloaded prompt and needs a cleaner prompt before running another command.
