description: Install Nexus CLI and initialize a project with one setup command
---

Nexus helps teams initialize context-driven development in one step after installation.

## Start Here

1. Install the CLI:

```bash
cargo install nex-us --bin nexus
```

2. Initialize Nexus in your project root:

```bash
nexus setup
```

## Navigation

- Product and usage pages are authored manually in `docs/content/docs`.
- Long pages expose a right-rail table of contents to keep orientation while reading.

## Contributing

1. Add or edit MDX pages under `docs/content/docs`.
2. Keep heading hierarchy (`##`, `###`) to improve TOC quality.
3. Validate local docs with `just docs` before publishing changes.
